# :wilted_flower: The Iris flower model
A model that predicts the species of Iris flower _(iris setosa, iris versicolour, iris virginica)_ based on four different parameters namely sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 
# :zap: Algorithm used 
It is trained using the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm wherin an object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors.  The object is then  assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). When k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
